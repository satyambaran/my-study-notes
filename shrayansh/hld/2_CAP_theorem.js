/*

Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance

Desirable property of distributed system with replicated data
    : Can not use all three property together when we have replicated data

    * Consistency:          After successful write, all nodes should have same value.
    * Availability:         All nodes should respond.
    * Partition Tolerance:  System is up even if communication breaks between servers.
